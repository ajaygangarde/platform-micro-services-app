Node.js Backend + React Frontend 🚀
I'm thrilled to share my recent learnings on deploying a full-stack application using AWS services and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation! 💡
Here's what I’ve covered so far:
🔹 Two Backend Node.js Services deployed as Docker containers on AWS ECS:
service-job-board-post (Port 4001)
service-job-board-user (Port 4002)
🔹 Frontend React Application:
Deployed directly to AWS S3 for cost-effective static hosting (no container needed).
🔹 GitHub Actions:
Automating the deployment pipeline from code commit to production!
Coming Soon 🚀:
🔗 Connecting MySQL RDS to backend services.
🔒 Setting up SSL Certificates and securing services.
⚖️ Integrating an API Load Balancer for scaling and availability.
🔐 Implementing Authentication to secure services with token-based access.
✅ Enhancing the GitHub Workflow to include:
Unit Testing with Jest.
End-to-End Testing with Cypress JS.
