# Full-Stack Deployment with AWS, Docker, and GitHub Actions ðŸš€

This project demonstrates how to deploy a full-stack application using **AWS ECS**, **ECR**, **S3**, **GitHub Actions**, and Docker. It includes two backend Node.js services and a React frontend.

## Features
- **Backend Services**:
  - `service-job-board-post` (Port 4001)
  - `service-job-board-user` (Port 4002)
  - Dockerized and deployed on **AWS ECS** via **ECR**.

- **Frontend Application**:
  - Built with React.
  - Hosted on **AWS S3** for cost-effective static hosting.

- **CI/CD Automation**:
  - **GitHub Actions** for building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Upcoming Enhancements
1. Connect **MySQL RDS** to backend services.
2. Add **SSL Certificates** for secure communication.
3. Integrate **API Load Balancer** for better scaling and availability.
4. Implement token-based **Authentication** for secure service access.
5. Extend **GitHub Workflow** with:
   - Unit testing using **Jest**.
   - End-to-end testing using **Cypress**.
